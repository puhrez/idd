          <p>In short, the Institute of Design and
        Development is an educational sytem focused on developing autonomous learners and 
        innovative thinkers using pragmatic pedagogy and engaging collaboration.</p>
        <p>We are an institute that seeks to enable tomorrows innovators to do what love, explore new fields and concepts while also developing there own skills. We are an institute for the designers and developers of tomorrow's systems and experiences. We reject the added-vale pedagogy for a more amorphous adaptive path of growth. At the institute we seek to enable the movers and shakers to find other people with complementary ideas or contradicting philosophies. In order to promote this sense of maturity the first year or semester of our students is entirely dedicated to gaining more real work experience and through that experience finding themselves. We refer to this as our "walkabout" as its goal, like its namesake, is the impetus of personal growth.</p>
        <p>Every student has his or her advisor who will serve as the students guide through his or her studies and will help direct the broader personal growth of our students to achieve their goals and discover new goals.</p>
        <p>More about the walkabout can be found on the roadmap page

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>This experience is one of those which separates from the average institute of higher education. It also echoes our dedication to enabling systems of free personal growth. A unique environment where exploration is encouraged and innovation is a byproduct of that process.</p>
        <p>This experience is meant to shape our students into more focused, more experienced, and more mature individuals prepared for the intensive, collaborative, and independent nature of our curriculum and life style.</p>

        <p>We do not operate by accreditation via hours spent in a chair listening to a droning lecturer, but rather by proficiency implementation of a concept or technique. Nor do we operate via 15 week sessions. Breaks exist when the student decides not take any courses for the moment, preferably for wither reflection, relaxation, or independent growth.
As a institute with its ideals held within the grasp of realty we must enforce several global requirements for our students.

                 Before the Walkabout
                </a>
          </h5>
        <p>Students move to one of our housing units located throughout the metropolitan area of Puerto Rico. More information about the housing found here.</p>
        <p>They meet their advisors and are exposed to not only the opportunities for their Walkabout where the university has a relationship, but also the methods of creating your own opportunity</p>
        <h5><a href="#AcaRoad"
                 rel="bookmark"
                 title="link to parent section">
                 The Walkabout
                </a>
          </h5>
        <p>The Walkabout is tradition of many aborigine cultures of Australia, but it’s conceptual basis can also be found in other cultures’ traditions. The idea behind this practice is to effectively separate oneself from  temporal and societal reality. In this we mean to say that this is a time of reflection and self-discovery with disregard for one’s past and one’s future.</p>
        <p>Our implementation varies by the student as they along with their advisor work together before the first year to formulate their Walkabout. In general, however, it is about thrusting the student into the real world, granted with the support safety net of the Institute. Despite this they are effectively left to their own devices and their successful completion of this Walkabout is paramount to their success in this Institute. Failure to complete the Walkabout will result in a review of their experience and a judgement on what the next steps may be.</p>
        <p>The opportunities that the students participate in vary by the student, but in general we encourage participation in fields that Puerto Rico desperately needs, namely agricultural work and education, specifically in the maths, sciences, and critical thinking components. Our partnerships with various agricultural organizations such as El Departamento de la Comida, El Departamento de Agricultura, El Departamento de Educación, and various public schools throughout the area give our students a plethora of choices as to where they may go.</p>
        <p>In addition to these more organized opportunities the student is free to develop their own opportunity and submit it for review by his advisor and the administration.</p>
        <p>This experience is wrapped up with a  colloquium involving the student, the student’s advisor, and a member of the administration.In this colloquium we look for maturity and sense of self.</p>
        <p>The standard time from start of the Walkabout to completion is about 7 to 8 months, yet the student is free to apply for the colloquium anytime after their 6th month.</p>
        <h5><a href="#AcaRoad"
                 rel="bookmark"
                 title="link to parent section">
                 After The Walkabout
                </a>
          </h5>
          <p>Having completed the Walkabout successfully, we now view the student as a fully cognizant adult and we treat them as such, giving them full access to the Institute’s internal opportunities, namely the ability to work with the administration. More information on the administration may be found here.</p>
          <p>After the Walkabout the student begins their class cycles, navigating through the plentiful course selection we can offer due to our flexible and staunchly anti-bureucratic structure.</p>
          <p>The student is given total freedom in regard to their course schedule and are responsible for their successful completion of our requirements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this time their advisor continues to play a key role in the personal development and academic career of the student, however their role diminishes slightly as the student progresses in their field. By the end 15 courses the student is highly recommended to seek out a mentor, faculty or otherwise. This mentor plays the role of career and professional advisor providing the pathways through which the student may better develop themselves in their field of choice.</p>
          <p>While there is no formal limit to the time it may take complete the various requirements stipulated, due to budgetary concerns, after three calendar years after the Walkabout, if the student has not completed the requirements, the student is given the opportunity to appeal for an extension. These particulars change, however, if the student is participating in the Aided Development track.</p>
          <p>For example, our IBM partnership requires enough courses that it would be ill-advised to complete them in three year</p>
        <h5><a href="#AcaRoad"
                 rel="bookmark"
                 title="link to parent section">
                 Time Abroad
                </a>
          </h5>
          <p>As part of our goal of promoting personal growth as much as professional growth, we require our students to acquire some abroad experience during their studies. Thanks to the high percentage of blended-learning classes we offer, many of our courses are often easily enhanced to allow for study abroad if the student wishes to continue his course load abroad.</p>
          <p>This experience much like the Walkabout, is rather student-dependent, but we encourage exploration of countries not of predominantly western-influence such as those of eastern-orientations or of high percentage of indigenous population. The student may choose to find an internship abroad or some sort of work, simply travel. 
          <p>For the former two options we provide several opportunities in a  multitude of fields like Tech development with Microsoft in Africa, Database management of Seed Banking efforts in South America, and many other like opportunities. These are all entirely funded for and the majority of them include stipends.</p>
          <p>For traveling, for strictly budgeting concerns we limit the amount of funding the student may receive for several reasons. Primarily, for budgetary reasons and also practical reasons, it is not our role as an Institute of Higher Education to be paying for the student’s beach time. Moreover, this limit on funding does not limit the student’s time abroad, but forces them to seek other venues of funding.</p>
          <p>Again, if the student is on the Aided Development track these particulars may be modified.</p>
        <h5><a href="#AcaRoad"

                 Summer Internship
                </a>
          </h5>
          <p>As an Institute focused on applied knowledge and skill development, we require all students to participate in our co-op program. This program requires students to spend a minimum of 2 months full time of the year or 4 to 5 months part time working in their field. This expectation begins after the student has declared their mentor.</p>
          <p>In addition to the mentor’s role in aiding the students in finding these opportunities, the student is also given freedom in their ability to find opportunities and even create their own opportunities with other students. These self-designed co-ops must be approved by their mentor and if the student is working on his own opportunity, regular end meets (in accordance with SCRUM methodology) are held with the mentor and a review board composed of fellow students to ensure productivity and commitment. </p>

                 Graduation
                </a>
          </h5>
          <p>Despite the fact that our schedule is nonconventional, we do maintain a somewhat normal graduation. Normal in that we hold it once a year in late May per custom because it a beautiful month in Puerto Rico and what is better than to celebrate the student’s achievements on a sunny day at the Beach? Somewhat normal because we do not believe in granting passage to you into the real world, nor do we believe that capes and gowns signify maturity and success, nor we believe that graduations should be tedious, boring, rather uniform ceremonies followed by tears of departure. </p>
          <p>We believe that graduation should be a moment of celebration for the efforts of the students, we believe that graduations should reflect the group of students graduating. Because of these beliefs our “graduation ceremony” is more like a graduation expo, were the graduating students are given the space and freedom to demonstrate their capacity to design and develop exciting ideas, projects, and products!</p>

  This means that rather than boxing our students  or professors efforts to a certain category we promote modular and interconnected courses. This is not to say that there are no prerequisites or introductory courses, those are necessary for establishing and maintaining a high level of learning.

              <p>While students are mostly encouraged to pursue interdisciplinary fields and interests, specialization indispensable in the formation of forward thinking groups. The ability to be a master in one subject but also a journeyman in several others allows for a scope of knowledge and breadth of experiences essential to the successful and efficient development of truly innovative systems by enabling a deeper sense of collaboration and also higherlevel of reasoned decision making. Because of this philosophy we maintain a somewhat strict curriculum spread.</p>
              <p>Each student needs to complete the following number of concepts for their respective difficulty level.<p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Introduction: 7</em></li>
                <li><em>Exploratory: 5</em></li>
                <li><em>Intermediate: 10</em></li>
                <li><em>Total: 30</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>We say concepts because we appreciate that different courses will be quick for some students and fast for other students depending on the intensity of the approach as well as the time dedicated. Our classes don't operate on grades but rather project reviews where a focus is put on the efficient, creative, and pragmatic implementation on the concepts learned. Moreover this amount reflects a minimum that should be achieved by all students and tries to be flexible for the individual pursuits of the students through their walkabout, co-op, time abroad or personal projects.</p>
              <p>In an aside if the student has enough skill to complete all the courses work without actually taking the class he may prove this via a project that goes under review. To note, these reviews are quite scrupulous to ensure full qualification for passing the course and this mechanism can only be applied for 5 of the courses.</p>
              <p>This number of concepts to be mastered reflects the desire to acquire a broad horizontal stack or proficiency at a wide array of skills and knowledge while also enforcing vertical development or mastery in certain key aspects of an individuals path.</p>
              <p>Despite of our nontraditional schedule, on the administrative side we maintain a varying, yet regularly spread selection of courses throughout the year.</p>

        <p>Our preliminary round consists of project reviews. That is every applicant is required to submit a project of some kind in whichever medium they see fit. This allows to make an easy cut in the number of applications we receive without biasing towards more fortunate applicants as most high school students of all socioeconomic backgrounds do not bother with substantive projects.</p>

        <p>Projects may come in the form of (but not limited to):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Life experience essays,</li>
            <li>Art portfolios,</li>
            <li>Software,</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Our second round is an interview.</p>
        <p>These interviews serve as not only a way to actually get the know the applicant but it may also serve as a portfolio review for those who have begun to develop themselves.</p>

        <p>Our acceptance standards are thus:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Determination</li>
            <li>Passion</li>
            <li>Articulation</li>
            <li>And results.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>No one factor above is the most important, nor are they the only factors, but these characteristics and moreover the demonstrated capacity for these attributes is what we look for.</p>

        <p><em>Admission Statistics:</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Applicants in 2013: 5241</li>
            <li>Accepted: 300</li>
            <li>Enrolled: 276</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <p><em>Graduation Statistics:</em></p>
        <p>While our graduation mechanic is quite unusual. <a href="#graduation" rel="bookmark" title="link to graduation info">See here</a> We do believe in a maintaining reliable post-graduation prospective statistics.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Percent of students enrolled who graduate within 6 years: <p class="percentages">87%</p></li>
          <li>Percent of Indepedent Development track students who acquired gainful employment within 6 months after graduation: <p class="percentages">93%</p><p>Note: we encourage our students to donate their skills to voluntary causes. I.E. Peace Corps, Code for America, etc.</p>
            <p>Also note: Aided Development track employement is inheritly <p class="percentages">100%</p></p></li>
            
          <li>Percent of Independent Development track students that start their own ventures after graduaton: <p class="percentages">68%</p><p>Note: Many students join together and cofound great forward thinking organizations</p></li>

          <p>First and Second year students are housed in suite style apartments in Santurce Puerto Rico near the university.</p>
          <p>Case dependent, upperclassman may apply for extended housing and depending on certain criteria, namely financial need and dependency (meaning they are not from Puerto Rico).</p>
          <p>Professors are granted apartments, if they so desire, in the same building of the lowerclassman to support mentorship and connections between faculty and students.</p>
          <p>The students suites are not self-organized (namely students selecting their roommates) but are constructed to house students of different concentrations while trying to find some common ground.</p>

          <p>For example,</p>
          <p>one suite may be of UX designers, web developers, and Devops students. While they all pursue different studies, their pursuits intertwine. This organization system promotes early considerations of team-building,  expansion of understanding of other aspects of their field, and the development of personal and professional relationships that allow for the students to push themselves towards greatness in a free and accepting environment.</p>

        <p>While most schools on this page would detail their endowment investment strategies for the future, alumni support funds, etc using quite florid, and often, artificial language. We’d prefer to maintain our openness and state clearly how we operate.</p>
        <p>With our $50 million endowment provided by George Soros and the Steve Jobs Estate, we were able to purchase wonderful facilities in the heart of Puerto Rico’s ‘Montmatre’, Santurce. This money is being currently invested in Energy research companies, Agricultural initiatives, and most importantly, in the startups and business which our students and alumni create.</p>
        <p>We are proud to say that our school is free of charge for those who attend thanks to the generous and plentiful private sector and public sector donations we receive. These relationships are made and maintained thanks to our Aided Development track. More information on this can be found here. 
        <p>In addition to these donations and partnerships, we benefit greatly from the tax incentives the Puerto Rican government gives to not only educational institutes, but also for those granted to organizations specializing in what is popularly referred to as STEM industry development and labour.</p>
        <p>More information on these tax benefits can be found <a href="http://www.puertoricoistheanswer.com/introduction.html" title= "link to Puerto Rico tax info page">here</a></p>
        <p>Because the majority of our 30 faculty members are independently wealth due to their involvement in high-profit innovative businesses, we are blessed with the ability to retain their knowledge, time, and skills for a mere $70,000. This allows us to focus our money on what is most crucial to the school, providing open access to any student capable of succeeding in our school.</p>
        <p>The main components of our annual Budget is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instruction and Research: 2,100,000$</li>
            <p>This includes the salaries of the professors at our institute.</p>
          <li>Maintenance and Operations: 3,285,000$</li>
            <p>This includes the costs of maintaining and operating our facilities.</p>
          <li>Advisement: 1,050,000$</li>
            <p>This covers the salaries of the advising/administrative staff of 15.</p>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Average Annual Budget: 8,435,000$</em></p>

          <p>As <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/" title="link to Valve Corp's page">Valve</a> says, Welcome to Flatland! Here everyone makes the same wage, here everyone has an important role in developing the institute. Rather than a hirachy, we like to imagine the structure a web of distributed duties. Moreover all our information, minus the obviously confidential stuff as bank access info or personal information not related to the school is public and records being automated scripts are well kept.</p>
          <p>Rather than a board we have something more akin to shareholders. Not equal to the financial definition in that we owe our a shareholders a money of which there is never surplus as we are keen to reinvest consrasntly, but rather a broader denifition that encompasses donators who hold shares in our vision, our process, and our results.</p>
          <p>There are no departments. Our professors and our students are encouraged to explore interdisciplinary perspectives.</p>
          <p>The students themselves are also not divided. We believe division by age or time of enter is silly, to say it plainly.</p>

        <p>Administration, like much at the Institute, is done rather non-traditionally. In keeping with our philosophy of flatland, we do not have a president, nor a board of directors, or shareholders. But rather systems of distributed responsibilities.</p>
        <p>They are thus:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Business partnership development:</li>
            <p>
            This is a small group of people responsible for maintaining and creating our partnerships with various private and public sector groups.</p>

            <li>Academic development:</li>
            <p>
            This is a small group of people responsible for professor hires, course approvals, and aspects of the academic operations of the institute.</p>

            <li>Student development:</li>
            <p>
            This is a small group of people responsible for admissions, student life, and maintaining a motivated and unified student body.</p>
          </ul>
        <p>These three groups are composed primarily of the advisement staff, however, they are supplemented by a healthy portion of students and faculty.</p>

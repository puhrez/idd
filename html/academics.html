        <p>We do not operate by accreditation judged by hours spent in a chair listening to a droning lecturer, but rather by proficiency, the ability to implement a concept and/or technique. Nor do we operate via 15 week sessions. Breaks exist when the student decides not take any courses, preferably for reflection, relaxation, or independent growth.</p>
<p>As a institute with its ideals held just beyond the grasp of realty we must enforce several global requirements for our students.

                 Before the Walkabout
                </a>
          </h5>
        <p>Students move to one of our housing units located throughout the metropolitan area of Puerto Rico. More information about the housing found here.</p>
        <p>They meet their advisors and are exposed to not only the opportunities for their Walkabout where the university has a relationship, but also the methods of creating your own opportunity</p>
        <h5><a href="#AcaRoad"
                 rel="bookmark"
                 title="link to parent section">
                 The Walkabout
                </a>
          </h5>
        <p>The Walkabout is tradition of many aborigine cultures of Australia, but it’s conceptual basis can also be found in other cultures’ traditions. The idea behind this practice is to effectively separate oneself from  temporal and societal reality. In this we mean to say that this is a time of reflection and self-discovery with disregard for one’s past and one’s future.</p>
        <p>Our implementation varies by the student as they along with their advisor work together before the first year to formulate their Walkabout. In general, however, it is about thrusting the student into the real world, granted with the support safety net of the Institute. Despite this they are effectively left to their own devices and their successful completion of this Walkabout is paramount to their success in this Institute. Failure to complete the Walkabout will result in a review of their experience and a judgement on what the next steps may be.</p>
        <p>The opportunities that the students participate in vary by the student, but in general we encourage participation in fields that Puerto Rico desperately needs, namely agricultural work and education, specifically in the maths, sciences, and critical thinking components. Our partnerships with various agricultural organizations such as El Departamento de la Comida, El Departamento de Agricultura, El Departamento de Educación, and various public schools throughout the area give our students a plethora of choices as to where they may go.</p>
        <p>In addition to these more organized opportunities the student is free to develop their own opportunity and submit it for review by his advisor and the administration.</p>
        <p>This experience is wrapped up with a  colloquium involving the student, the student’s advisor, and a member of the administration.In this colloquium we look for maturity and sense of self.</p>
        <p>The standard time from start of the Walkabout to completion is about 7 to 8 months, yet the student is free to apply for the colloquium anytime after their 6th month.</p>
        <h5><a href="#AcaRoad"
                 rel="bookmark"
                 title="link to parent section">
                 After The Walkabout
                </a>
          </h5>
          <p>Having completed the Walkabout successfully, we now view the student as a fully cognizant adult and we treat them as such, giving them full access to the Institute’s internal opportunities, namely the ability to work with the administration. More information on the administration may be found here.</p>
          <p>After the Walkabout the student begins their class cycles, navigating through the plentiful course selection we can offer due to our flexible and staunchly anti-bureucratic structure.</p>
          <p>The student is given total freedom in regard to their course schedule and are responsible for their successful completion of our requirements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this time their advisor continues to play a key role in the personal development and academic career of the student, however their role diminishes slightly as the student progresses in their field. By the end 15 courses the student is highly recommended to seek out a mentor, faculty or otherwise. This mentor plays the role of career and professional advisor providing the pathways through which the student may better develop themselves in their field of choice.</p>
          <p>While there is no formal limit to the time it may take complete the various requirements stipulated, due to budgetary concerns, after three calendar years after the Walkabout, if the student has not completed the requirements, the student is given the opportunity to appeal for an extension. These particulars change, however, if the student is participating in the Aided Development track.</p>
          <p>For example, our IBM partnership requires enough courses that it would be ill-advised to complete them in three year</p>
        <h5><a href="#AcaRoad"
                 rel="bookmark"
                 title="link to parent section">
                 Time Abroad
                </a>
          </h5>
          <p>As part of our goal of promoting personal growth as much as professional growth, we require our students to acquire some abroad experience during their studies. Thanks to the high percentage of blended-learning classes we offer, many of our courses are often easily enhanced to allow for study abroad if the student wishes to continue his course load abroad.</p>
          <p>This experience much like the Walkabout, is rather student-dependent, but we encourage exploration of countries not of predominantly western-influence such as those of eastern-orientations or of high percentage of indigenous population. The student may choose to find an internship abroad or some sort of work, simply travel.</p>
          <p>For the former two options we provide several opportunities in a  multitude of fields like Tech development with Microsoft in Africa, Database management of Seed Banking efforts in South America, and many other like opportunities. These are all entirely funded for and the majority of them include stipends.</p>
          <p>For traveling, for strictly budgeting concerns we limit the amount of funding the student may receive for several reasons. Primarily, for budgetary reasons and also practical reasons, it is not our role as an Institute of Higher Education to be paying for the student’s beach time. Moreover, this limit on funding does not limit the student’s time abroad, but forces them to seek other venues of funding.</p>
          <p>Again, if the student is on the Aided Development track these particulars may be modified.</p>
        <h5><a href="#AcaRoad"

                 Summer Internship
                </a>
          </h5>
          <p>As an Institute focused on applied knowledge and skill development, we require all students to participate in our co-op program. This program requires students to spend a minimum of 2 months full time of the year or 4 to 5 months part time working in their field. This expectation begins after the student has declared their mentor.</p>
          <p>In addition to the mentor’s role in aiding the students in finding these opportunities, the student is also given freedom in their ability to find opportunities and even create their own opportunities with other students. These self-designed co-ops must be approved by their mentor and if the student is working on his own opportunity, regular end meets (in accordance with SCRUM methodology) are held with the mentor and a review board composed of fellow students to ensure productivity and commitment. </p>

                 Graduation
                </a>
          </h5>
          <p>Despite the fact that our schedule is nonconventional, we do maintain a somewhat normal graduation. Normal in that we hold it once a year in late May per custom because it a beautiful month in Puerto Rico and what is better than to celebrate the student’s achievements on a sunny day at the Beach? Somewhat normal because we do not believe in granting passage to you into the real world, nor do we believe that capes and gowns signify maturity and success, nor we believe that graduations should be tedious, boring, rather uniform ceremonies followed by tears of departure. </p>
          <p>We believe that graduation should be a moment of celebration for the efforts of the students, we believe that graduations should reflect the group of students graduating. Because of these beliefs our “graduation ceremony” is more like a graduation expo, were the graduating students are given the space and freedom to demonstrate their capacity to design and develop exciting ideas, projects, and products!</p>

              <p>The first and radical distinction between our academic organization is the lack of departments and concentrations but rather interdisciplinary paths. 
  This means that rather than boxing our students  or professors efforts to a certain category we promote modular and interconnected courses. This is not to say that there are no prerequisites or introductory courses, those are necessary for establishing and maintaining a high level of learning.

          </header>
              <p>While students are mostly encouraged to pursue interdisciplinary fields and interests, specialization indispensable in the formation of forward thinking groups. The ability to be a master in one subject but also a journeyman in several others allows for a scope of knowledge and breadth of experiences essential to the successful and efficient development of truly innovative systems by enabling a deeper sense of collaboration and also higherlevel of reasoned decision making. Because of this philosophy we maintain a somewhat strict curriculum spread.</p>
              <p>Each student needs to complete the following number of concepts for their respective difficulty level.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Introduction: 7</em></li>
                <li><em>Exploratory: 5</em></li>
                <li><em>Intermediate: 10</em></li>
                <li><em>Total: 30</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>We say concepts because we appreciate that different courses will be quick for some students and fast for other students depending on the intensity of the approach as well as the time dedicated. Our classes don't operate on grades but rather project reviews where a focus is put on the efficient, creative, and pragmatic implementation on the concepts learned. Moreover this amount reflects a minimum that should be achieved by all students and tries to be flexible for the individual pursuits of the students through their walkabout, co-op, time abroad or personal projects.</p>
              <p>In an aside if the student has enough skill to complete all the courses work without actually taking the class he may prove this via a project that goes under review. To note, these reviews are quite scrupulous to ensure full qualification for passing the course and this mechanism can only be applied for 5 of the courses.</p>
              <p>This number of concepts to be mastered reflects the desire to acquire a broad horizontal stack or proficiency at a wide array of skills and knowledge while also enforcing vertical development or mastery in certain key aspects of an individuals path.</p>
              <p>Despite of our nontraditional schedule, on the administrative side we maintain a varying, yet regularly spread selection of courses throughout the year.</p>

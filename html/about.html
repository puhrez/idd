          <p>In short, the Institute of Design and
        Development is an educational system focused on developing autonomous learners and 
        innovative thinkers using pragmatic pedagogy and engaging collaboration.</p>
        <p>We are an institute that seeks to enable tomorrow's innovators to do what they love and to explore new fields and concepts while also developing their own skills. We are an institute for the designers and developers of tomorrow's systems and experiences. We reject the added-value pedagogy for a more amorphous, adaptive path of growth. At the institute we seek to allow the movers and shakers to find other people with complementary ideas and/or contradicting philosophies. In order to promote this sense of maturity the first year or semester of our students is entirely dedicated to gaining more real work experience and through that experience finding themselves. We refer to this as our "walkabout" as its goal, like its namesake, is the impetus of personal growth.</p>
        <p>Every student has an advisor who will serve as the student's guide, a venerable Vigil, through their studies. They also help direct the broader personal growth of our students, aiding them to achieve their goals and discover new goals.</p>
        <p>More about the walkabout can be found on the roadmap page

        </p>
        <p>This experience is one of the many which separates us from the average institute of higher education. It also echoes our dedication to enabling opporunties for unrestricted personal growth. These experiences help create a unique environment where exploration is encouraged and innovation sought after from day one.</p>
        <p>This experience is meant to shape our students into more focused, more experienced, and more mature individuals prepared for the intensive, collaborative, and autonomous nature of our curriculum and life style.</p>

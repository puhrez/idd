        <p>While most schools on this page would detail their endowment investment strategies for the future, alumni support funds, etc using quite florid, and often, artificial language. We’d prefer to maintain our openness and state clearly how we operate.</p>
        <p>With our $50 million endowment provided by George Soros and the Steve Jobs Estate, we were able to purchase wonderful facilities in the heart of Puerto Rico’s ‘Montmatre’, Santurce. This money is being currently invested in Energy research companies, Agricultural initiatives, and most importantly, in the startups and business which our students and alumni create.</p>
        <p>We are proud to say that our school is <em>free of charge </em>for those who attend thanks to the generous and plentiful private sector and public sector donations we receive. These relationships are made and maintained thanks to our Aided Development track. More information on this can be found<a href="#AcaTrack"
                 rel="bookmark"
                 title="link to academic track section"> here</a>. </p>
        <p>In addition to these donations and partnerships, we benefit greatly from the tax incentives the Puerto Rican government gives to not only educational institutes, but also for those granted to organizations specializing in what is popularly referred to as STEM industry development and labour.</p>
        <p>More information on these tax benefits can be found <a href="http://www.puertoricoistheanswer.com/introduction.html" title= "link to Puerto Rico tax info page">here</a></p>
        <p>Because the majority of our 30 faculty members are independently wealth due to their involvement in high-profit innovative businesses, we are blessed with the ability to retain their knowledge, time, and skills for a mere $70,000. This allows us to focus our money on what is most crucial to the school, providing open access to any student capable of succeeding in our school.</p>
        <p>The main components of our annual Budget is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instruction and Research: 2,100,000$</li>
            <p>This includes the salaries of the professors at our institute.</p>
          <li>Maintenance and Operations: 3,285,000$</li>
            <p>This includes the costs of maintaining and operating our facilities.</p>
          <li>Advisement: 1,050,000$</li>
            <p>This covers the salaries of the advising/administrative staff of 15.</p>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Average Annual Budget: 8,435,000$</em></p>

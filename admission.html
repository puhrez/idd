      </header>
        <p>Our preliminary round consists of project reviews. That is every applicant is required to submit a project of some kind in whichever medium they see fit. This allows to make an easy cut in the number of applications we receive without biasing towards more fortunate applicants as most high school students of all socioeconomic backgrounds do not bother with substantive projects.</p>

        <p>Projects may come in the form of (but not limited to):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Life experience essays,</li>
            <li>Art portfolios,</li>
            <li>Software,</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Our second round is an interview.</p>
        <p>These interviews serve as not only a way to actually get the know the applicant but it may also serve as a portfolio review for those who have begun to develop themselves.</p>

        <p>Our acceptance standards are thus:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Determination</li>
            <li>Passion</li>
            <li>Articulation</li>
            <li>And results.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>No one factor above is the most important, nor are they the only factors, but these characteristics and moreover the demonstrated capacity for these attributes is what we look for.</p>

        <p>In short, this school is intended for indepedent, curious individuals with a penchant for intensity and commitment</p>

          <p>First and Second year students are housed in suite style apartments in Santurce Puerto Rico near the university.</p>
          <p>Case dependent, upperclassman may apply for extended housing and depending on certain criteria, namely financial need and dependency (meaning they are not from Puerto Rico).</p>
          <p>Professors are granted apartments, if they so desire, in the same building of the lowerclassman to support mentorship and connections between faculty and students.</p>
          <p>The students suites are not self-organized (namely students selecting their roommates) but are constructed to house students of different concentrations while trying to find some common ground.</p>

          <p>For example,</p>
          <p>one suite may be of UX designers, web developers, and Devops students. While they all pursue different studies, their pursuits intertwine. This organization system promotes early considerations of team-building,  expansion of understanding of other aspects of their field, and the development of personal and professional relationships that allow for the students to push themselves towards greatness in a free and accepting environment.</p>

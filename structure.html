          <p>As <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/" title="link to Valve Corp's page">Valve</a> says, Welcome to Flatland! Here everyone makes the same wage, here everyone has an important role in developing the institute. Rather than a hirachy, we like to imagine the structure a web of distributed duties. Moreover all our information, minus the obviously confidential stuff as bank access info or personal information not related to the school is public and records being automated scripts are well kept.</p>
          <p>Rather than a board we have something more akin to shareholders. Not equal to the financial definition in that we owe our a shareholders a money of which there is never surplus as we are keen to reinvest consrasntly, but rather a broader denifition that encompasses donators who hold shares in our vision, our process, and our results.</p>
          <p>There are no departments. Our professors and our students are encouraged to explore interdisciplinary perspectives.</p>
          <p>The students themselves are also not divided. We believe division by age or time of enter is silly, to say it plainly.</p>

        <p>Administration, like much at the Institute, is done rather non-traditionally. In keeping with our philosophy of flatland, we do not have a president, nor a board of directors, or shareholders. But rather systems of distributed responsibilities.</p>
        <p>They are thus:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Business partnership development:</li>
            <p>
            This is a small group of people responsible for maintaining and creating our partnerships with various private and public sector groups.</p>

            <li>Academic development:</li>
            <p>
            This is a small group of people responsible for professor hires, course approvals, and aspects of the academic operations of the institute.</p>

            <li>Student development:</li>
            <p>
            This is a small group of people responsible for admissions, student life, and maintaining a motivated and unified student body.</p>
          </ul>
        <p>These three groups are composed primarily of the advisement staff, however, they are supplemented by a healthy portion of students and faculty.</p>
